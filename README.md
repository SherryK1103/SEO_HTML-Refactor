# SEO_HTML-Refactor

## Description
I wanted to convert this webpage to one that was accessible to screen readers. Previously, people with visual impairments would not have been able to navigate the page well without semantic elements. Also, the semantic elements help the page be search engine optimized. I learned how to consolidate redundant CSS styles and apply them to HTML elements.

## Installation
To install code, run the following command:
Git clone <paste SSH key>
